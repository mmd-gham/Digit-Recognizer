# Digit-Recognizer
This project introduces a user-friendly GUI application built with Python that uses supervised machine learning to recognize handwritten digits. The application allows users to draw a digit directly on the screen, and the model then predicts the digit based on the user's input.  

How it Works:

1. Drawing Recognition: The application captures the user's handwritten digit using a canvas. Each stroke of the pen is recorded as data points. 
2. Data Processing: The captured data is transformed into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms. 
3. Machine Learning Model: A pre-trained machine learning model (likely a neural network) is employed to analyze the processed data and predict the corresponding digit. 
4. Prediction Display: The model's prediction is displayed to the user, indicating the recognized digit. 

Features:

* User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) makes it easy for users to interact with the application.
* Real-Time Prediction: The model predicts the digit in real-time as the user draws, providing instant feedback.
* Data Storage: The handwritten digit data is stored in a CSV file for potential future training or analysis.

Project Highlights:

* Supervised Machine Learning: The project demonstrates the application of supervised machine learning techniques for image recognition.
* GUI Development: The application showcases skills in building interactive GUI applications using Python libraries like Tkinter or PyQt.
* Data Management: The project handles data collection, processing, and storage for use in training the machine learning model.
